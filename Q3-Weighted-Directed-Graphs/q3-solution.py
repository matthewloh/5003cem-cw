Question 3: Graph
Write a program that uses graph concepts. The program should fulfil the following requirements:
• Construct a weighted directed graph class that consists of the following methods:
    o listAdjacentVertex: for a given vertex, this method should list all adjacent vertices.
    o heaviestVertex: for a given vertex, this method should which of the adjacent vertices
        have the highest weight.
• Create two different graph objects (with at least 8 vertices, 30 edges and random weights) and
    call the above two functions and display the results.
Explain the method/design you used to represent the graph structure in your program.
